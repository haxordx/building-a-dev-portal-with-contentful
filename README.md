This is the source code for a live-coding stream [ianjennings](https://github.com/ianjennings) did with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). 
In this stream, we created a basic developer portal (based off of Google Codelabs) that includes a list of tuturials, tags, difficulty, etc. Each tutorial contains a number of steps that include code samples, expected duration,  etc.
